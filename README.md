# Lethal Achievements

Lethal Achievements is a mod for Lethal Company that adds achievements. Since this game does not include achievements, I decided to create a mod to add them into the game.
This mod contains 3 main features:

* A popup that appears in the corner of the screen to inform you when you unlock an achievement
* A terminal command to show all of your unlocked achievements
* Saving to a file to make it not delete your achievements when you close the game. Achievements are save-specific and not global (if you start a new save it will restart your achievement progress)

Custom achievements are currently not supported, but might be in a future update.

I was inspired to create this mod when I stumbled across [this](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1966720/discussions/0/4032474464292386098/) Steam community post. Many of the achievement ideas came from here, so credit goes to them for the idea.

There are currently 8 achievements in this mod.

## Terminal

Now, I wouldn't want to spoil the fun by telling you about all the achievements and how to get them, but you can preview the names of them by using the "Achievements" terminal command.
This command also shows if you have unlocked, or have not unlocked any of the achievements.

## Installation - r2modman (recommended)

1. Install [r2modman](https://for-the-king.thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/)
2. Click the 'Install with Mod Manager' button on top above
3. Run the game through r2modman

## Installation - manual

1. Extract the 'LethalAchievements.zip' file
2. Go through the folders until you find 'LethalAchievements.dll'
3. Place this file in 'Lethal Company/BepInEx/plugins'
4. Run the game through Steam

## Config

There are 2 config options, the option to change the popup notification scale and a toggle to turn the popup sound on or off. It is recommended to leave these on the default value, but you may change them if you wish.
